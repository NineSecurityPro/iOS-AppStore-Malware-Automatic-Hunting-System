# BlackHat USA 2018 Arsenal -- App-Store-Malware-Automatic-Hunting-System

## Introduction
As we all know, iOS system of Apple would be one of the most securable among all popular operating systems. From technical view, the protection feature of sandbox gardened application, runtime code signing check, hardware level application code packing protection and so forth, what is more, the Apple Store security check policy is so strict before any application is released on Apple Store, all these security methods together guaranteed iOS suffered the least malware and vulnerability attack.

However, this would be bad news for security vendors for the defense protection solution has no chance to be granted sufficient privilege so as to detect and defeat attack in deep level when end user suffered real APT attack such as PEGASUS. So the detection and defend solution towards iOS platform is really deserving the name of “dancing with shackles”.

This tool would be the first to introduce the tricks and lesions of Apple Store apps automatic crawling and security sandbox automatic analysis systems for security researchers and security vendors in the world.
